Steps
1. Import necessary libraries required for the assignment.
2. Loaded the dataset
3. Checked for missing values.
4. Checked for duplicates. Which almost half of the dataset is duplicated,
   but dropping duplicates isn't necessary because in real life cases, each row will be linked to 
   a certain account id meaning that two or more persons may have the same skill. Therefore dropping
   duplicates will leave some individuals out of the selection.
5. Performed web scrapping; extract a list of soft skills and write it to a csv file.
6. created a function that will extract the rows that correspond to each soft and hard skills 
and write them to csv files separately.
